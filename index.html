<h3>Professional Experience</h3>
  <h4>Barista, Jewel Box Cafe  -  <i>July 2023-Present</i></h4>
  I worked as a barista making smoothies, bubble tea, coffee, crepes, and sandwiches in a fast-paced environment. I handled store upkeep and closing procedures each night with efficiency and teamwork with the other employees. I assisted customers with both friendliness and effective service.
  <h4>Farmers Market Sales Associate, The French Guys  -  <i>May 2023-August 2023</i></h4>
    I set up, organized, and sold various hgih-quality pastries and bread during early mornings and at evening markets. I answered customer questions regarding preperation, ingredients, and cooking advice while keeping the stall clean. I broke down the tent, tables, and pastry trays at the end of the day to be loaded onto the truck.
